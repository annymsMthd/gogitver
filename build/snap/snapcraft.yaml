description: |
  gogitver is a tool to determine the semantic version of a
  project based on keywords used in the commit history. gogitver
  draws a lot of inspiration from GitVersion but with the benefit
  of go's single binary executable. With the work done by go-git
  the binary produced can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
